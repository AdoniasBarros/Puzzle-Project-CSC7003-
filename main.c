/* REQUIREMENTS 
*	The game was all developed in C language;
*	The game can be played by 1 player;
*	The grid (board) has the size of 5 letters per 5 letters (5x5);
*	The board generates random letters without considering the possible words;
*	The words used in the game are provided by the developer in a separated dictionary, a “dic.txt” file. It is possible for the user to change the dictionary, it is just *	necessary to put a file with the same name in the same folder as the executable game.;
*	The difficulty is defined by time, when chosen the difficulty the user has the following time to make the maximum points:
*	Easy Level: 5 minutes;
*	Medium Level: 3 minutes;
*	Hard Level: 2 minutes;
*	The punctuation follows the English Version of the Scrabble game which are:
*
*Letters
*	Points
*	E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
*	1 point
*	D, G
*	2 points
*	B, C, M, P
*	3 points
*	F, H, V, W, Y
*	4 points
*	K
*	5 points
*	J, X
*	8 points
*	Q, Z
*	10 points
*
*The first screen is a Menu containing all the information necessary to the user, as instructions to play, to choose the level, to show the time, the punctuation and how to *exit;
*The user need to form words with the grid with the objective to obtain the maximum punctuation in the defined time;
*
*
* 
* TESTS
*difficulty entry in the first different from 'e', 'm' or 'h' the game will expect a right enter
*if option is not 'r' 'c' 't' or 'f' the entry is invalid
*
*
*
* FIXED PROBLEMS
*04/02/2016
*PROBLEM FIXED: Repeated positions in the random matrix, when changing rows or columns others were changed 
*The problem in the positions of the random matrix creation and in the rotatePositionRow was fixed
*changing the static matrix alocation by the dinamic matrix alocation
*all the calls of the functions were changed to adapt to the new dynamic allocation i.e char puzzleGrid[][] -> char **puzzleGrid 
*time to fix the bug: 5 hours
*
*
*02/02/2016
*PROBLEM FIXED: Different reponses in scanfs, miss behavior
*The problem in the scanf was fixed separating the letter and world scanfs and putting a space before the %c
*It was seen that the %c scanf accept special characters, so every loop when the user taps 'ENTER' the scanf catchs
*this entry and treat it as a new entry to the next scanf, so the space is needed to ignore this behavior of the scanf 
*time to fix the bug: 3 hours
*
*
*06/02/2016
*PROBLEM FIXED: Time elapse problem
*Time elapsing counting in a wrong way
*time to fix the bug: 2 hours
*
*
*06/02/2016
*PROBLEM FIXED: Dictionary problem
*Problem to scan words in the dictionary
*
*
*time to fix the bug: 5 hours
*
*
*
*bug: tipe difficult with more than one letter
*bug: negative rows and columns or values out of the 0 to 5 size
*improvement: pass the dictionary to an array
*change the name of the variables
*definir constantes para os numeros #define 
*
*
